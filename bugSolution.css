Several workarounds exist to address the incompatibility of `filter: blur()` on SVG elements:

**1. Using a `<foreignObject>`:**

This approach involves wrapping the SVG content within a `<foreignObject>` element, allowing the CSS filter to apply correctly.

```html
<div>
  <foreignObject>
    <svg width="100" height="100">
      <!-- SVG content here -->
    </svg>
  </foreignObject>
</div>
```

**2. Using JavaScript-based blurring:**

In cases where `<foreignObject>` is not suitable, consider using a JavaScript library like `html2canvas` to render the SVG to a canvas and then apply a blur using the canvas API.

**3. Server-side SVG rendering and blurring:**

As a last resort, generating the blurred SVG on the server-side before serving it to the client can resolve the issue.
